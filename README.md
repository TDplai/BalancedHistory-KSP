# BalancedHistory

This is a little modlet for Kerbal Space Program that balances Making History parts against stock and commonly accepted modding standards.

WARNING: WILL CHANGE SOME PART SIZES - BEWARE

Total list of part size changes available in wiki.

Feel free to fork and work on the code yourself. When you feel your edits are ready to be merged into Balanced History, send me a Pull Request to merge into the Development branch.
