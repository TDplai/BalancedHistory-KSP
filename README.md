This is a little modlet for Kerbal Space Program that balances Making History parts against stock and commonly accepted modding standards.

WARNING: WILL CHANGE SOME PARTS - BEWARE WHEN USING ON SAVES WITH THESE PARTS

Feel free to fork and work on the code yourself. When you feel your edits are ready to be merged into Balanced History, send me a Pull Request to merge into the Development branch, at which point they will be packaged in Development releases. If your changes are deemed mature enough, they may be merged and worked on until stable, at which point they will get packaged in Stable releases.
